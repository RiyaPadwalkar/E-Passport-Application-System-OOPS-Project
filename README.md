# Passport-Management-System-C++-Project-

The Passport Management System implemented in C++ is designed to streamline tasks such as new passport registrations, renewals, appointments, police verification, and payments. The code demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance (e.g., details class extended by renewal, New_Registration, and appointment), polymorphism (use of virtual functions like show()), friend functions (e.g., display), constructors/destructors (e.g., in payment class for managing resources), and encapsulation (storing user details and processing data securely). This structure enhances modularity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and extend.
